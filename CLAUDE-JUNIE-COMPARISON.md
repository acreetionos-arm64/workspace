### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas Where Technical Context Was Missing

1. **Repository Configuration Understanding**
   - Junie recommended generic pacman setup
   - **Reality**: Custom AcreetionOS repositories already configured (iso.acreetionos.org)
   - **Impact**: Recommendations don't align with existing infrastructure

2. **Custom Package Ecosystem**
   - Junie gave generic ARM64 package advice
   - **Reality**: 25 custom -git packages already identified for compilation
   - **Impact**: Underestimated the custom build requirements

---

## Contextual Understanding Gaps

### 1. Multi-Repository Architecture Awareness
**üî¥ MAJOR OVERSIGHT**

**What Junie Missed**:
- 10-submodule sophisticated architecture
- Repository-specific WBS numbering (1=iso-builder, 2=arm64-toolchain, etc.)
- Cross-repository dependency management
- Coordinated development across specialized domains

**What Junie Provided**: Single-repository focused recommendations

### 2. Professional Infrastructure Recognition
**üü° MODERATE OVERSIGHT**

**Existing Infrastructure Junie Didn't Recognize**:
- GitHub Organization: `acreetionos-arm64` with unlimited repos
- Project Board: Unified issue tracking across all submodules
- Documentation Standards: Technical architecture and contribution guidelines
- Development Workflow: Established submodule update procedures

### 3. Timeline and Resource Planning
**üü° MIXED ASSESSMENT**

| Aspect | Junie's Estimate | Existing Plan |
|--------|------------------|---------------|
| **Timeline** | Immediate implementation focus | 18-36 month sustainable development |
| **Approach** | Fast-path completion | Learning-focused, quality-over-speed |
| **Resources** | Technical implementation only | Complete resource planning including hardware requirements |
